# Livenetwork evaluation

So, the code has passed all tests and is now ready for the first entering of the live-network. This should be done on few nodes, run by team members. The code has now to prove, that chaotic behaviour, external influences and the much bigger scale is no problem for this new piece of software.
The second thing is, it has to be monitored, that the new code does not harm the network himself.
After this phase is successfully finished, testing is done and the release is ready for a mass rollout.
