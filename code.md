#Developing Code

Every developer is resposible for testing his own code, he plans to add to the platform. No news here.
Additionally, he should write some notes (or a full documentation ;) ) about the new feature and to make the development perfect, he should also write some testcases for the following stage, where the code is tested in a test environment, like a Lab- or a testnet.
The testcases are neccessary to retest the function on a following release.
After this is done, the new code will be added to the dev-repo, which is ideally only visible to testers.
The new developed code must be kept away from the main branch until it is finally released (see emergency_fix for reason).
